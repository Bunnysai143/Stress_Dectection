'''Hey there r/assistance, Not sure if this is the right place to post this.. but here goes =) I'm currently a student intern at Sandia National Labs and working on a survey to help improve our marketing outreach efforts at the many schools we recruit at around the country. We're looking for current undergrad/grad STEM students so if you're a STEM student or know STEM students, I would greatly appreciate if you can help take or pass along this short survey. As a thank you, everyone who helps take the survey will be entered in to a drawing for chance to win one of three $50 Amazon gcs.'''
